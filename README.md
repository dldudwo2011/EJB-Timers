# EJB-Timers
Jakarta EE 9 - EJB Timers

This project demonstrates my ability to:

- Schedule a automatic EJB timer to download CSV files.

- Schedule a programmatic EJB timer to check and handle the status of a batch job.

- Send an email programmatically using JavaMail and the WildFly mail subsystem.

- Create a batchlet to import data from a CSV file to a database table.
